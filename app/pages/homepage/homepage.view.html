					We are pleased to introduce the new Performance Management System for the employees of Archirodon.
				</p>
				<p>
					Performance Management is an annual process that links employees and jobs to the strategy of the organization and establishes a shared understanding of what has to be achieved and how. It is a tool that monitors and ensures that employees are doing the right things, in the most effective ways, and to the best of their ability.
				</p>
				<p>
					Performance Management aims to:
					<div style="padding-left:50px">
						<ul style="list-style-type:disc; ">
							<li>Clarify what is expected of employees and how they can contribute to the success of their team.</li>
							<li>Encourage an ongoing dialogue between employees and their direct supervisor / Manager throughout the year.</li>
							<li>Evaluate and measure the performance of employees in a fair, objective and consistent manner.</li>
							<li>Provide balanced feedback and guidance to employees.</li>
							<li>Provide employees with opportunities for professional development, growth and career advancement.</li>
							<li>Recognize good performance and enhance the motivation of employees.</li>
							<li>Align company and individual performance, helping all to work in the same direction.</li>
						</ul>
